     <strong><u> Knowing how to write </u></strong>an informative paragraph is essential to producing a successful expository essay. An informative paragraph must be five sentences; it must also have a specific structure, including a topic sentence,<br/> three supporting sentences and a concluding sentence. Research your topic thoroughly before writing an informative paragraph and remember it's your job to assume an authoritative voice on a subject and inform readers in a clear, concise manner that makes them feel as if they now know what you know.

<br/>
Determine the topic of your informative paragraph. Remember, the point of an informative paragraph is to give the reader new information or explain how to do something. Topic choices for an informative paragraph are broad and varied. <br/>You can write on anything from, "How to Get Straight A's With Six Siblings at Home", to "How to Make Grits With Cheese."

2Determine the subject of your paragraph

Determine the subject of your paragraph. If your paragraph is a part of a larger essay, the subject will depend on its placement within your essay.<br/><br/> For example, in "How to Make Grits With Cheese", the first paragraph might be about how much you love making the dish. The second paragraph might be about the history of grits. The third paragraph might go into explaining how to boil the water, add the grits and salt, and stir. The fourth paragraph might explain the different types of cheeses you can use. The fifth paragraph might discuss what else you can eat with the dish, like biscuits, shrimp or bacon.

3To let the reader
<br/>
Form your topic sentence to let the reader know what your paragraph will be about. If your paragraph is about how to serve grits, the topic sentence might read, "Grits are best served piping hot."
<br/><br/>
4Write three sentences

Write three sentences to support your topic sentences. For example, "As grits cool, they harden and congeal, losing their fluid texture. Serving them while the steam is still rising will ensure that your cheese melts quickly and thoroughly. Be careful not to splash any on your skin while holding your plate as grits are cooked in boiling water and can burn your skin."
